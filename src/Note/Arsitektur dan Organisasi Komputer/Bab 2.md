Over the years, the cost of computer systems has significantly decreased while their performance and capacity have dramatically increased. Modern laptops have the computing power of IBM mainframes from 10-15 years ago, making computing power nearly "free." This affordability has led to disposable microprocessors, such as those in digital pregnancy tests. The technological advancements have enabled complex applications. For example, desktop applications that require the great power of today's microprocessor-based systems include:

- Image processing
- 3D rendering
- Speech recognition
- Videoconferencing
- Multimedia authoring
- Voice and video annotation of files
- Simulation modeling

Workstations now support sophisticated engineering and scientific applications, while powerful servers handle transaction and database processing for businesses, replacing old mainframe centers. Cloud service providers also use high-performance servers for high-volume applications. Interestingly, the basic building blocks of modern computers are similar to those from over 50 years ago, but the techniques to maximize performance have become more sophisticated.
