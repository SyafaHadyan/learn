## Structure and Function

A hierarchical system is a set of interrelated subsystems; each subsystem may, in turn, contain lower level subsystems until the lowest level of elementary subsystem.

> **Structure**: The way in which the components are interrelated.
>
> **Function**: The operation of each individual component as part of the structure.

### Function

There are only four basic functions that a computer can perform:

- **Data Processing**: Data may take a wide variety of forms, and the range of processing requirements is broad.
- **Data Storage**: Computer process data on the fly and at any given moment, the computer must temporarily store those pieces of date that are being worked on and there are a sort-term data storage function and a long-term data storage function.
