### Software Specification

Software specification (requirements engineering) is the process of understanding and defining what **services** are required from the system and identifying the **constraints** on the systemâ€™s operation and development.

Software specification focuses on **WHAT TO BUILD**.

Phases/activities:

- Requirements elicitation and analysis
- Requirements specification
- Requirements validation

Software validation or, more generally, verification and validation (V & V) is the process of showing that a system both conforms to its specification and meets the expectations of the system customer.

Software validation focuses on **FINDING BUGS AND ERRORS**.

Strategies/stages:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Validation/requirements testing
