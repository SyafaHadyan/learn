# BAB 2 PROSES PERANGKAT LUNAK DAN MODEL SDLC (BAG. 1)

## Proses perangkat lunak (software process)

- Software Specification
- Software Development
- Software Validation
- Software Evolution

### Software Specification

Software specification (requirements engineering) is the process of understanding and defining what **services** are required from the system and identifying the **constraints** on the systemâ€™s operation and development.

Software specification focuses on **WHAT TO BUILD**.

Phases/activities:

- Requirements elicitation and analysis
- Requirements specification
- Requirements validation

Specification role: software analyst

### Software Validation

Software validation or, more generally, verification and validation (V & V) is the process of showing that a system both conforms to its specification and meets the expectations of the system customer.

Software validation focuses on **FINDING BUGS AND ERRORS**.

Strategies/stages:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Validation/requirements testing

Techniques:

- Black box testing
- White box testing

Software validator role: software tester

### Software Evolution

Software evolution (software maintenance) is the process of changing software over its lifetime after delivery in response to the evolving requirements and customer needs.

Evolution roles: software analyst, software designer, software programmer, software testing.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC is a series of phases that provide a common understanding of the software-building process.

SDLC model is a simplified representation of a software process.

Each model represents a process from a particular perspective (context).

### Waterfall

![Waterfall](https://github.com/SyafaHadyan/learn/blob/main/src/Note/Rekayasa%20Perangkat%20Lunak/Pictures/Bab%202/Waterfall.png)

- Introduced by Royce (1970).
- Interaction between subsequent phases -> next phase begins once the previous phase is complete.
- Quality must be assessed and controlled in all phases
- Each phase has specific deliverables

### Prototyping

### Spiral
