# Writing Requirement

## Introduction

- Requirements engineering is a technical process
- It is certainly not like writing a novel, or a book like this; it is not even like the kind of "technical writing" seen in instruction manuals and user guides
- In writing a requirements document, two aspects have to be carefully balanced:
  - The need to make the requirements document readable
  - The need to make the set of requirements processable

## Good Requirements Are SMART

- Specific
  - It must address only one aspect of the system design or performance.
  - It must be expressed in terms of the need (what and how well), not the solution (how).
- Measurable
  - Performance is expressed objectively and quantitatively
  - E.g., an exact pointing requirement (in degrees) can be tested thus verified prior to launch.
- Achievable
  - It must be technically achievable at costs considered affordable
  - E.g., JWST early designs specified an aperture requirement eventually descoped due to technical issues with deployment.
- Relevant
  - It must be appropriate for the level being specified
  - E.g., requirement on the solar cells should not be designated at the spacecraft level.
- Traceable
  - Lower level rerquirements (children) must clearly flow from and support higher level requirements (parents).
  - Requirements without a parent are referred to as orphans, and need to be assessed for necessity of inclusion.
