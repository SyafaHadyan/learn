# Writing Requirement

## Introduction

- Requirements engineering is a technical process
- It is certainly not like writing a novel, or a book like this; it is not even like the kind of "technical writing" seen in instruction manuals and user guides
- In writing a requirements document, two aspects have to be carefully balanced:
  - The need to make the requirements document readable
  - The need to make the set of requirements processble
