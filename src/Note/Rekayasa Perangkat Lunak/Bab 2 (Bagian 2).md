# BAB 2 PROSES PERANGKAT LUNAK DAN MODEL SDLC (BAG. 2)

## Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)

![DSDM](https://github.com/SyafaHadyan/learn/blob/main/src/Note/Rekayasa%20Perangkat%20Lunak/Pictures/Bab%202/DSDM-0.png)

![DSDM](https://github.com/SyafaHadyan/learn/blob/main/src/Note/Rekayasa%20Perangkat%20Lunak/Pictures/Bab%202/DSDM-1.png)

- Introduced by DSDM Consortium (1994), universally available in 2007.
- DSDM Consortium became Agile Business Consortium (2016) -> url: [https://www.agilebusiness.org/](https://www.agilebusiness.org/).
- Improvement to RAD (lack of rigour -> reduced quality).
- Implements Agile approach (Agile Manifesto).

### Kelebihan DSDM

- Early implementation to business problems.
- Reducing risk of building the wrong solution.
- Incorporate stakeholders into the development process.
- Incremental delivery.
- Users will be better trained.
- Deployment is more likely to go smoothly.

### Kekurangan DSDM

- Costly to implement.
- IT professionals and end users must be trained accordingly.
- Requires full commitment to DSDM process.
- Involves progressive development of requirements.

### Menerapkan DSDM Bila

- Systems that are time constrained.
- Systems where requirements can be prioritized.
- Interactive systems, where functionality is clearly demonstrable at the user interface.
- Inappropriate for critical-mission projects.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

![Extreme Programming](https://github.com/SyafaHadyan/learn/blob/main/src/Note/Rekayasa%20Perangkat%20Lunak/Pictures/Bab%202/ExtremeProgramming.png)

- Developed by Kent Beck (1996).
- Recognizes 5 values:
  - communication
  - simplicity
  - feedback
  - courage
  - respect
- Implements Agile approach (Agile Manifesto).
- Relies on constant code improvement, pairwise programming.
- 5 basic principles:
  - small releases
  - 40-hour work week
  - on-site customer
  - collective ownership
  - coding standards

### Kelebihan Extreme Programming (XP)

- Eliminate defects early, reducing cost.
- User involvement in the development team.
- Increased user satisfaction.
- Cohesive developer environment.
- High productivity and quality code.

### Kekurangan Extreme Programming (XP)

- Lack of specification and design documents.
- Requirements are expressed informally.
- Requirements conflicts due to multiple stakeholders.
- Potentially scope creep.
- Neglected planning.
- Requires experienced developers.
